you hear us offici like john mccain or clueless republican presidenti candid like marco rubio or carli fiorina all crow for a safe zone in northern syria thi is what they are refer to see map abov their safe zone just so happen to be in the exact same area where isi is current hold court it s a safe zone alright but not for refuge and syrian flee the evil bashar al assad rather the safe zone will be for an array of rebel and terrorist fighter part of a defacto sunni state-lett in wait so the us-l coalit s safe zone is the veri caliph that american are decri for anyon requir proof that such a grand chessboard is in play in syria they need look no further than a set of us airstrik that took place befor christma on decemb 6 2015 us fighter bomber struck a syrian militari base locat in the villag of ayyash in deir ezzor provinc east of raqqa which kill 3 syrian arab armi saa soldier and wound addit other natur the pentagon swiftli deni that ani such attack took place what happen after thi incid wa extrem tell as explain by global affair analyst mike whitney from counterpunch magazin it s also worth note that accord to south front militari analysi the us bomb raid coincid with a a full-scal isi offens on the villag of ayyash and bgelia in other word the us attack provid suffici air-cov for isi terrorist to carri out their ground oper wa that part of the plan or wa it mere a coincid so the us air forc wa coordin with isi boot on the ground to achiev a common militari object but it didn t end there less than 24 hour after the attack us warplan bomb the villag of al-khan in north-eastern syria kill 26 syrian civilian includ at least four women and seven children and four women the messag the us militari is send with these lethal attack is that it want to control the air-spac over east syria where it plan to remov isi and establish a de facto sunni state consist with it scheme to break syria and iraq into smaller canton govern by local warlord islam fanat and us puppet also take place at the same moment on dec 6th wa turkey s quiet littl invas into northern iraq send hundr of troop and at least 20 tank into territori north of mosul right between the kurd and isi it should be note that thi illeg incurs by nato member turkey wa not approv by the iraqi govern in baghdad and iraqi pm haider al-abadi call for turkey to immedi withdraw it troop judg by washington s silenc on the matter it s obviou that the us gave turkey it full bless here zero hedg astut point out the obviou most importantli of all right on what al-arabi al-jade claim is the smuggl rout for illeg isi crude into turkey from iraq not surprisingli turkey s sudden move also came at the same time that russia began to publicli expos turkey s clandestin role in facilit the isi oil trade as well as launch airstrik to destroy isi oil convoy move from syria into turkey and then turkish leader recep tayyip erdo an photo left place hi militari asset at the veri locat where stolen isi oil make it way from iraq into turkey hardli a coincid make no mistak both end of nato s militari axl the unit state and turkey along with their saudi-back boot on the ground in isi and al nusra have each made critic strateg move in unison and with a specif militari purpos each time nudg toward secur territori onc each key piec is final in posit all that is requir is a new crisi either in the region or in europ or in america to allow the axi power to move in quickli and take what is need to implement the next phase of the game whether that s creat a kurdish canton or a sunni state-lett such move will rare be cover by the western intern media to be perfectli clear the term sunni and shia are the favor sectarian lexicon use by nation builder inc and it intern partner in riyadh and tel aviv my intent here is not to reduc the muslim world down to thi paradigm but the architect of instabl will use these term over and over in their attempt to both margin and dehuman muslim for their own selfish end what s the safe zone for as the us-l coalit step up it 18 month-long punch n judi air oper to supplant isi from raqqa those western-back jihadi will later requir a safe corridor to flee but still remain connect to their turkish suppli line washington s safe zone would also provid a much-need safe haven for rebel who have been sent pack by the syrian govern from town like hom and other as part of a painstak disarm and reconcili process between the assad govern and opposit rebel who are will to particip in the program onc the nato-gcc axi ha establish a mini protector insid of syria thi will provid everyth isi al nusra ahrar al-sham turkmen et all will need a secur launch pad for incurs further insid syria which will certainli guarante a longer protract conflict in syria and beyond thi littl sunni wedg is also conveni locat next to a larg rebel-terrorist conting in syria s northwestern idlib governor provinc syria s border with turkey ha been porou from the begin of the conflict so the propos safe zone will allow turkey to maintain thi statu quo where it ha been continu allow the free-flow of weapon rebel and terrorist fighter alik along with oil narcot and human traffick to move freeli through it southern border with syria if regim chang rhetor is anyth to go by along with turn a blind eye to nato member turkey s role in facilit suppli line and safe passag for al qaeda and isi then washington s agenda is fairli transpar here if they can establish a intern recogn safe zone and a no-fli zone on top of it central planner believ they will have the platform they need to eventu destroy damascu instal their own western puppet and then carv up syria and northern iraq accordingli isi rat-lin black market oil ha been a key compon to carri on both conflict in syria and iraq for the architect of instabl in washington one crucial benefit of carv out sunni territori in both northern and eastern syria is that avail oil will help fund all of their paramilitari and terrorist need make it sustain to guarante thi uninterrupt incom stream from black market oil which is present make it way out of syria and into turkey and via kurdistan help is requir from the kurdish region govern krg and other stakehold includ the british-turkish firm genel energi just one firm who is provid the end-run to market for illicit isi oil ditto for a key mover and shaker in raqqa s new rockefel class bilal erdogan the son of turkish presid who accord to numer recent report ha alreadi amass a small fortun from the lucr oil-for-terror trade thi is a problem but one which washington london and pari are not overli concern with much less upset about iraqi kurdish and turkish opposit offici have accus turkish govern and the krg of deliber allow some of these smuggl oper to take place even as provision state-lett and canton are conjur around it there is no guarante that greater kurdistan will ever see the light of day if nation builder inc have anyth to say bout it the promis of greater kurdistan is as import to neocolonialist than the realiti of a greater kurdistan turkey also ha it own interest and ambit and a greater kurdistan is not compat with them iraq is not crazi about the idea either becaus of obviou financi and energi resourc reason so they remain in limb indefinit even as smaller quasi-kurdish entiti sprout up around the krg turkey ha it own ongo kurdish problem within turkish border so ankara will natur view ani express of kurdish autonomi around it as a threat and potenti inspir for intern kurdish solidar rule over the kurd mean keep them divid and play them off against their neighbor there are those within the turkish establish who believ there are old score still unsettl in reclaim turk territori in both syria and iraq see also special report isi oil follow the money back to europ here is where sunnistan proper can emerg come into it own onc set piec are in place in iraq and across kurdistan as mike whitney explain so it look like an agreement ha been struck between turkey the krg and the unit state to seiz part of northern iraq and eastern syria to creat a de facto sunni state that will be jointly-control by ankara and washington it also look like obama ha agre to use dodgi jihadi-proxi aka terrorist to work alongsid us special forc to carri out futur militari oper so while the effort to remov assad ha been temporarili put on the backburn the determin to destroy syria is as strong as ever anoth dismemb part of old syria and iraq which central planner are hope to hack-off is an area call rojava see map abov or western kurdistan thi region in northern syria formerli known as syrian kurdistan gain it autonomi in novemb 2013 as part of the ongo rojava revolut the kurdish defens forc here are known as the ypg peopl s defens unit and are not on friendli foot with neighbor turkey for a number of reason not least of all becaus ypg defens forc present resist to both al nusra and isi encroach into all three rojava canton for turkey thi is bad for busi how rojava will factor into washington s plan is not clear yet but it occupi the most strateg squar on the chessboard make no mistak the histori s actor are all in for thi plan do not be fool by talk of peac and stabil or humanitarian platitud from western leader the un or the fair weather intern commun anoth indic that these plan have the full back of the neoconserv illiterati and israel too wa pnac walru and former us ambassador to the un john bolton s recent articl in the establish s daili journal of polit poster the new york time where he state today s realiti is that iraq and syria as we have known them are gone the islam state ha carv out a new entiti from the post-ottoman empir settlement mobil sunni opposit to the regim of presid bashar al-assad and the iran-domin govern of iraq also emerg after year of effort is a de facto independ kurdistan central planner will happili frame thi geopolit scenario within the prefer theme of sunni vs shia sectarian strife in the region which just happen to suit the interest and desir of both saudi arabia and israel bolton confirm thi if in thi context defeat the islam state mean restor to power mr assad in syria and iran s puppet in iraq that outcom is neither feasibl nor desir rather than strive to recreat the post-world war i map washington should recogn the new geopolit the best altern to the islam state in northeastern syria and western iraq is a new independ sunni state not so fast mr ambassador the islam state is the sunni state so for all intent and purpos he s call for the establish of the caliph funni how thi goe right over the head of conserv thi is just one of mani geostrateg move which will guarante instabl and militari conflict in the region for anoth
